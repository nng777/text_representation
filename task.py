Part 3: Practical Application
Task 3.1: Document Classification Preparation
Create a mini document classification system:
1.Collect 20 documents from 2 different categories (e.g., sports vs technology news (from detik.com/cnnindonesia.com/kompas.com), positive vs negative reviews)
2.Convert each document to both TF-IDF and Word2Vec representations
3.Calculate similarity scores between documents using cosine similarity
4.Analyze which method (TF-IDF vs Word2Vec) better separates the two categories

Requirements:
1.Use real text data (not the examples from the lesson)
2.Implement cosine similarity calculation
3.Create a simple visualization or table showing the separation

Deliverable:
1.Python script with your implementation
2.Dataset used (or clear instructions on how to obtain it)
3.Analysis report comparing TF-IDF vs Word2Vec effectiveness
